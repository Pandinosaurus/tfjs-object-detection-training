After we have collected and labeled our first round of images, we are ready to start training our model! 

## Prepare to Export to Colab
To train our model we need to install the Cloud Annotation CLI.

#### Click Train in Colab
There's a green button on the top right of your screen that says "Train in Colab". Click that to get started.
